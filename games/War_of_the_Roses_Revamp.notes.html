The Wars of the Roses (1455-1487), were a series of civil wars fought over control of the English throne in the mid- to late fifteenth century. These wars were fought between supporters of two rival branches of the royal House of Plantagenet: Lancaster and York. The wars extinguished the last male line of the house of Lancaster in 1471, leading to the Tudor family inheriting the Lancastrian claim to the throne. Following the war and the extinction of the last male line of the house of York in 1483, a politically arranged marriage united the Houses of Tudor and York, creating a new royal dynasty which inherited the Yorkist claim as well, thereby resolving the conflict.

The War of the Roses had its roots in the wake of the Hundred Years' War. After fighting a series of armed conflicts with France, English prestige was weakened by emergent socio-economic troubles. This weakened prestige unfolded structural problems with bastard feudalism, a system developed by the powerful duchies created by Edward III. Combined with the mental infirmity and weak rule of King Henry VI, these structural problems revived interest in the Yorkist claim to the throne by Richard of York.

This is alternate history for sure. Eight noblemen vie for control of the royal heirs.  Once all 9 royals have been captured a noble wins when he controls all the living royals.
Seven of the 9 royals start the game already captured. Victory can also be achieved by a noble who controls 6 of the 8 victory cities for one round. Check the projection of power button. Cathedrals can be destroyed. Some territories are slightly misplaced and/or have more land mass than the original. Originially this was the Roman Invasion map. There are no tech upgrades available.  It has been difficult to find early balance. 
I achieved the best results by (on turn one in edit mode) making Plantaganent and Talbot allies (Margaret and Henry) and Fitzalan and Nevelle allies. (Richard and his son) 
The AI does not seem to play Talbot well. If Talbot is destroyed then make Plantagenent and Courtney allies. Good luck. Crazy things will happen. :) I have more changes in mind but it is fun and playable as it is.
